# Nairobi_Air_Watch
The project will focus on air quality data from Nairobi, Lagos, and Dar es Salaam and thereafter build a time seriesmodel to predict PM 2.5 readings throughout the day. 
The data set contains PM (particulate matter), temperature, and humidity readings taken with low-cost sensors. These sensors measure the concentration of PM in the air.
